Ideally it would be better to make cookbooks to provision the software needed by Waymarked Trails.

Cookbooks can be downloaded directly from the [Chef repository](http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Chef+Repository), and the following should be usable without modification:

* apt
* git
* postgresql
* python

Ideally, any cookbooks that are usable should be added as git submodules.
